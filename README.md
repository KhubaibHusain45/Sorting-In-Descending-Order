This Java program demonstrates how to sort a list of strings in both ascending and custom descending order.

ðŸ”¹ What the Code Does:
Creates a list of strings: ["Khubaib", "Huzaifa", "Salman", "Zubair", "Ahmad"].

Prints the original list.

Sorts the list in natural (ascending) alphabetical order using Collections.sort().

Defines a method SortInDescending() that sorts the list in custom descending order based on the first character of each string.

ðŸ§  Note: The SortInDescending() method uses a custom comparator to reverse the order of strings based on the first character. However, it does not handle full alphabetical descending sortâ€”it only compares the first characters.
